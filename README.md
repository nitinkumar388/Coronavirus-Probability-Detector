# Coronavirus Probability Detector

## Idea for the solution of the coronavirus outbreak is:

Stop the transmission by prioritizing tests and hence detecting the cases quickly.

Data can be collected on the symptoms of COVID-19.

A machine learning model is then trained on the data to find out the probability of a person having the infection.

The model is then used to find out whom to test for the infection first under a limited testing capacity.

The same model can be used to find potential candidate for conducting random tests.

## Machine Learning model parameters:-

A team of doctors can sit down to find out the best model parameters.

A sample set of parameters is as follow
